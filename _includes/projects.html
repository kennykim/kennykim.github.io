      <p>Qar is a small project AI-based system in which a car in a grid learns how to drive avoiding walls. It uses Q-Learning algorithm to obtain the optimal policy via trial and error. The car has the option to choose one action before every tick and the car will move one square into the facing direction after the tick.</p>

          <li> Document classification </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This project was developed for the Yelp dataset challenge, it is a star predictor that uses Naive Baye's classification algorithm to classify a review into how many stars it has. The data was taken from Yelp webpage and half is used to train the classificator and the other half is used to test the classificator.</p>

        </ul>
      <p> Simple security project using a Raspberry Pi with a camera. The code detects motion and sends an email with the video feed to the user. </p>
    <p> Motion is detected by using the difference between two consecutive frames, and if the difference is substantial enough, then the camera stard saving those frames into a video. Once there is no movement, the video is closed and sent to the user. </p>

        </ul>
      <p> Simple racing car game created for the Msp430 with an attached LCD black and White display. The goal is to void as many cars as possible using the right and left buttons to move right and left. The graphics were created using pixel art. </p>
        <p> The game is developed in C in its entirety from handling pins to writing pixels to the screen to the abstracted game logic of detecting overlaps and accelerating the speed of the game. </p>
