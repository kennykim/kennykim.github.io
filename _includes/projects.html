      <p>Qar is a small project AI-based system in which a car in a grid learns how to drive avoiding walls. It uses Q-Learning algorithm to obtain the optimal policy via trial and error. The car has the option to choose one action before every tick and the car will move one square into the facing direction after the tick.</p>

          <li> Data Mining </li>
          <li> Document classification </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This project was developed for the Yelp dataset challenge, it is a star predictor that uses Naive Baye's classification algorithm to classify a review into how many stars it has. The data was taken from Yelp webpage and half is used to train the classificator and the other half is used to test the classificator. The results of the script are in number of correct and incorrect results and the error distance, which is a metric of how far the actual classification was from the predicted one. </p>
          <h3> Results </h3>
          <p> The classificator is able to predict correctly about 40% of the reviews, with an error distance of 2</p>

      <p> The application provides a map in which the user can hold a certain location, there the application will ask for a to-do message. When the device is close to the location specified (~ 1000 meters) the application will notify the user with the to-do message. </p>
